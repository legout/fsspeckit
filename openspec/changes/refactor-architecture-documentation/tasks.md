## 1. Research and Analysis
- [ ] 1.1 Analyze current implementation across all domain packages (core, storage_options, datasets, sql, common)
- [ ] 1.2 Document actual component relationships and integration patterns
- [ ] 1.3 Identify key architectural decisions that need documentation as ADRs
- [ ] 1.4 Review existing examples to understand real-world usage patterns

## 2. Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- [ ] 2.1 Write ADR-001: Domain Package Architecture (why this structure over alternatives)
- [ ] 2.2 Write ADR-002: Backend-Neutral Planning Layer (centralized vs. decentralized approach)
- [ ] 2.3 Write ADR-003: Façade Pattern for Backwards Compatibility (migration strategy)
- [ ] 2.4 Write ADR-004: Multi-Cloud Abstraction Strategy (provider-agnostic design)
- [ ] 2.5 Write ADR-005: Caching and Performance Architecture (design trade-offs)

## 3. Core Architecture Documentation
- [ ] 3.1 Draft Executive Overview section with purpose and value proposition
- [ ] 3.2 Write comprehensive domain package deep dive with real implementation details
- [ ] 3.3 Document component lifecycle and dependency management patterns
- [ ] 3.4 Document error handling and resilience architecture across packages

## 4. Integration Patterns and Extension Points
- [ ] 4.1 Document cross-domain integration patterns with practical examples
- [ ] 4.2 Document extension points and plugin architecture for custom development
- [ ] 4.3 Document common usage patterns and anti-patterns
- [ ] 4.4 Document configuration and deployment patterns

## 5. Performance and Production Architecture
- [ ] 5.1 Document performance optimization strategies and caching architecture
- [ ] 5.2 Document parallel processing and concurrency patterns
- [ ] 5.3 Document monitoring and observability architecture
- [ ] 5.4 Document production deployment patterns (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)

## 6. Enhanced Visual Documentation
- [ ] 6.1 Create updated Mermaid diagrams showing actual implementation structure
- [ ] 6.2 Create component interaction diagrams
- [ ] 6.3 Create data flow patterns diagrams
- [ ] 6.4 Create deployment architecture diagrams

## 7. Review and Validation
- [ ] 7.1 Technical accuracy review with codebase analysis
- [ ] 7.2 Review with stakeholders for completeness and clarity
- [ ] 7.3 Validate all code examples and integration patterns
- [ ] 7.4 Update related documentation for cross-reference consistency

## 8. Final Polish and Integration
- [ ] 8.1 Comprehensive editing for clarity, consistency, and completeness
- [ ] 8.2 Update any cross-references in other documentation files
- [ ] 8.3 Validate all internal links and references
- [ ] 8.4 Final quality check and formatting review
